# Short hands on tutorial on Markdown (md)
the symbol \# writes everything to its right in bold. Good for sectioning
adding more \## lowers the size of the bold text



## 1. Adding lines
***
 Adding three asterisks (\*\*\*) creates a line 

## Adding an hyperlink
Here it is a link to a basic writing guide in md
[hyperlink](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
The link can be written directly in the editor if showing URL is not an issue

## 2. Numbering
Just one \* adds a bullet point

* Alpha

* Beta

* Gamma

### Adding text to quote code
Adding the line \`\`\` \ will create a box where code can be quoted

```
 ssh user1234@something.somewhere
```
I will add more as I learn
